Simple program to extract data from MorningStar TriStar-MPPT-45 charge controller using ModBus protocol.
The program is run as a cron job (every 5 minutes should be enough) and the data dumped into a log file as comma separated value.
CGI scripts are used to plot historical data in differents formats: SVG, PNG, PDF.

dependencies:
libmodbus
gawk
gnuplot
http server with CGI (thttpd, apache,...)

The client reads from `/dev/ts_mppt' which should be a symbolic link to a serial device (possibly set by udev rule)
